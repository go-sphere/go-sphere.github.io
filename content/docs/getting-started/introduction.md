Sphere is a pragmatic Go backend toolkit centered on a clean monolithic template and a small toolchain that automates schema, API contracts, server stubs, Swagger, and even TypeScript clients.

What you build:
- Define entities with Ent and APIs with Protobuf
- Generate Go handlers, Swagger, error types, and client SDKs
- Compose services with Gin + Wire; deploy as a single binary

Next: Installation â†’ set up the toolchain.
